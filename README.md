In an era of unprecedented growth and transformation in the retail sector, my project stands at the forefront of addressing the challenges faced by retailers. As the industry dynamically adapts to shifting consumer behaviors and technological advancements, retailers strive to provide unparalleled in-store experiences and implement cutting-edge technologies. The sheer diversity of products in supermarkets often leads customers on a journey to find specific items, impacting both customer satisfaction and retailer resource management. By unraveling the intricacies of consumer behavior, we empower businesses to predict demand accurately, optimize inventory, and enhance overall retail management plans.

My primary goal is to provide retailers with a rich tapestry of insights, focusing on pivotal questions related to sales and product analysis. Through an exploratory journey, I address queries such as order timing, repeat purchase rates, shopping preferences, and co-purchasing dynamics. By categorizing these insights under precise conditions, my visualization promises to extract powerful knowledge from raw data.

Additionally, I delve into inventory portfolio visualization, shedding light on product arrangement and sales frequency. Unraveling the relationships between frequently co-purchased items, my exploration aids retailers in strategic decision-making, preventing potential dips in sales due to product discontinuations. Inspired by Ehrenberg's marketing strategies, I explore an anonymous purchase incidence model in a collaborative filtering environment, presenting an innovative approach to understanding consumer behavior.

By embracing this E-Commerce Exploration, retailers can anticipate heightened productivity, improved customer relationship management, and the formulation of effective marketing strategies. I unlock the hidden potential of your store's data, enabling you to thrive in the ever-evolving retail landscape.
